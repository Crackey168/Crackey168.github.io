<h3> High School</h3>
<p> In high school, I found myself interested in the social sciences, especailly economics. <br>
I liked how it combined my interest in math with my interest in real world issues. 
Like many nerds, Anime and Video games destroyed my social life. Eventually I got out of my <br>
League of Legends addiction and sort of got my shit together. By senior year, I was pretty <br>
tired of the boarding school life and was ready for college. </p>

<h3> College</h3>
<p> The start of College was a bit weird. I was one of the only people used to living away <br>
from home. Everyone was trying to figure out their place and it was all such a rush of one thing <br>
after another. Eventually, things got sorted out, had my friends and my academic goals. <br>
Since then, I've always wondered what's next. I spend more time than I probably should thinking <br>
about how to make progress on multiple levels: physically, socially, and academically. <br>
Ultimately, it chews up a lot of energy and I figured out you just need to stop thinking so much, <br>
work hard, do what feels right, and see where things take you. <br>
Now I'm just another senior questioning if they're ready to take on adult life. </p>
