Should be good to go! All files validated, 1 warning each, no errors! 

Most of what I tried to do with coding worked pretty well. Used my actual resume as an idea base
used a bunch of unordered list to add bullet points under various jobs/activities

Originally had used a lot of H2s, H3s, etc, but switched a lot to p's because there were spaces after each
header that I didn't want, making the resume a lot more spaced out. 
Had to go to the internet to figure out how to add spacing when I wanted it because the lines werent breaking simply 
by hitting enter. Found the <br> command, and saw that it was ok to use through a piazza question. 


Had trouble with commits after the first. Had forgotten to add a better commit message, 
but when I tried to commit again it just said my "branch was up to date with master/origin, nothing to commit".
Later I understood this was because I hadn't made any changes to the documents. 

When validating, I ran into a few errors. The index.html file was fine from the start. The css file was easy to fix,
only missing a few semi-colons. The resume.html file had a few errors involving the scope of p, saying it found 
/p tags but no p tags (even though there were). I think it was that i had unordered lists between them. Removed 
the unnecessary p and /p tags, got rid of those errors, and the page looked the same, which was good.
The most confusing one was Malformed byte sequence: 92. I got rid of this by removing the apostrophe 
in the title. Not sure why that was an issue, but it got rid of the error. After that, no more errors according
to validator. 


7-8 hours working on this project total, the coding part wasnt the worst, mainly problems
with figuring out how to get around git, github, vim, and command prompt.
