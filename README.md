Most of what I tried to do with coding worked pretty well. Used my actual resume as an idea base
used a bunch of unordered list to add bullet points under various jobs/activities

Originally had used a lot of H2s, H3s, etc, but switched a lot to p's because there were spaces after each
header that I didn't want, making the resume a lot more spaced out. 
Had to go to the internet to figure out how to add spacing when I wanted it because the lines werent breaking simply 
by hitting enter. Found the <br> command, and saw that it was ok to use through a piazza question. 

Had trouble with commits after the first. Had forgotten to add a better commit message, 
but when I tried to commit again it just said my "branch was up to date with master/origin, nothing to commit".


currently spent about 5 hours working on this project, the coding part wasnt the worst, mainly problems
with figuring out how to get around git. 

Jian Wei and I talked a bit about this project
